# WebServer
A simple web server written in python. Can serve html, js, css, images, and a few other files. 

Server logic is in server.py.

HTML pages are at root level. Images and text files are in books and pictures subdirectories respectively.

The server should be able to handle basic tasks, like serving up requested pages, redirecting to correct pages if a close but incorrect URL is provided, and handling responding with the correct status and a page for 404 not found.
